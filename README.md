# Lottery Licence Manager

The Lottery Licence Manager is a project by the
[City of Sault Ste. Marie](https://saultstemarie.ca/)
to meet the lottery licensing requirements of Ontario municipalities
as defined by the
[Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario](https://www.agco.ca/).

Although the system is quite niche, it's being released in an open source environment
in hopes to pool developer resources from other Ontario municipalities looking to move away from
older, legacy systems.
