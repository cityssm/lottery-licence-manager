The Lottery Licence Manager is a web application written by the
[City of Sault Ste. Marie](https://saultstemarie.ca/)
to meet the lottery licensing requirements of Ontario municipalities
as defined by the
[Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)](https://www.agco.ca/).

**⭐ Launched November 2021 ⭐**

Although the system is quite niche, it's being released in an open source environment
in hopes to pool developer resources from other Ontario municipalities
looking to move away from older, legacy systems.

It is being shared to start the dialog among other Ontario municipalities
and present an option to those who may be looking to refresh
their own lottery licensing systems.
