## Find an Organization with the Organization Search

![Organization Search](images/organization-search.png)

The starting point for finding an organization record is the Organization Search page.
You can find it in the navigation bar at the top of every page,
or on the home dashboard.

The Organization Search page offers several filters to help find organization records.

- Organization Name
- Representative Name
- Licence Eligibility (set to display eligible organizations only by default)

Note that both the Organization Name and Representative Name fields
are case insensitive and can take several search terms at the same time.

For example, the organization record for *Johnny's Society for Pet Saving*
can be found by searching for:

- `pet saving john`
- `pet society`

*Johnny's Society for Pet Saving* would not be found however by searching for
`johnnys pets` since neither term exists fully in the organization name.
For that reach, it is recommended to use more generic searches when possible,
and increase specificity if needed.

Search results are refreshed when you change the value of a search filter.
If the refresh is not triggered automatically, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
to trigger the refresh.

![Organization Search Result](images/organization-search-results.png)

Search results are displayed below the filters in a table,
and include the following columns.

- Organization Name, linked to the organization record
- Organization Note Indicator, if applicable
- Default Representative
- Organization Edit Link (depending on user permissions)
- Active Licences or Last Active Licence Date
- New Licence Link
