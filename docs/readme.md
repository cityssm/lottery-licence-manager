The Lottery Licence Manager is a web application written by the
[City of Sault Ste. Marie](https://saultstemarie.ca/)
to meet the lottery licensing requirements of Ontario municipalities
as defined by the
[Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)](https://www.agco.ca/).

While the application is built with Ontario municipalities in mind,
it is flexible enough to handle the lottery licensing demands of
municipalities in other jurisdictions.

## Features

-   "Out of the box" support for Ontario-based bingo, raffle,
    and break-open (Nevada) lottery licences.

-   Flexible reporting options that meet the requirements of municipalities,
    licence authorities, and inspectors.

-   Open source!  MIT licence!  No cost to use!
