![Lottery Licence Search](images/licence-search.png)

There are many ways to find a lottery licence record.
The Lottery Licence Search page offers another way, from a list of licence records.
You can find it in the navigation bar at the top of every page, or on the home dashboard.

There are several filters to help with finding lottery licences.

- Municipal Licence Number (a customized name for the External Licence Number field)
- Licence Type
- Organization Name
- Licence Status (set to display active lottery licences only by default)

Search results are refreshed when you change the value of a search filter. If the refresh is not triggered automatically, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to trigger the refresh.

Search results are displayed below the filters in a table and include the following columns.

- Licence Identifiers, linked to the lottery licence record.
- Licence Type and Licence Details.
- Organization Name, linked to the organization record.
- Location, linked to the Location record.
- Licence Date Range.
- Licence Edit Link, depending on user permissions.
- "Not Issued" Indicator or a Print Licence button.
